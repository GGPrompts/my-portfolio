  title: "The Journey: Analyst to Engineer in 180 Days",
  content: `I spent years as a Program Analyst, architecting IT systems and translating requirements into technical specs—but I never wrote the code. Six months ago, that changed. With Claude Code as my pair programmer, I went from zero coding experience to shipping production applications.

My background isn't traditional. I was an EA beta tester for Command & Conquer, achieving top 10 global rankings. That gaming experience taught me something crucial: complex systems are puzzles waiting to be solved. Build orders, resource optimization, split-second strategic decisions—these translate directly to software architecture, state management, and real-time system design.

I call myself a **Full Stack Prompt Engineer** not as a joke, but as a philosophy. I embrace AI-assisted development because it lets me focus on what I'm best at: understanding problems, designing architectures, and shipping solutions. Claude Code handles the syntax gymnastics while I handle the strategy.

My technical interests gravitate toward what I call "power user tools"—terminal UIs built with Go/Bubbletea, browser-based development environments with xterm.js integration, real-time collaborative apps. I love the terminal aesthetic because it strips away the noise and reveals the structure underneath.

This portfolio showcases 45+ projects built in six months. Some are rough experiments. Others are production-ready. All of them represent a belief that **the best time to start building is now**, and the best tools are the ones that multiply your velocity—whether that's AI, the command line, or both.`,
